## Overview

The Shenzhen Researcher House, initiated by the Ethereum economics research community Panta Rhei, aims to connect researchers and application developers in the Ethereum ecosystem through co-living, co-learning, and co-research. This initiative seeks to advance fundamental research and applied research in Ethereum.

The Shenzhen Researcher House will be a side event for ETH Shenzhen, gathering researchers before the main conference to delve into specific themes. During the conference, there will be a Researchathon, where research demos will be presented as research posts and talks.

## What is Blockchain Economics?

Blockchain economics refers to the mechanisms, incentives, and macroeconomic policies that coordinate value creation and distribution within crypto-economic networks. This new field combines economic design and software development.

**Why focus on blockchain economics?** The well-known blockchain trilemma (security, decentralization, and scalability) is often associated with the technical attributes of blockchain systems. However, their **economic attributes** are less discussed. Achieving breakthroughs in this field requires not only technological advancements but also the design of economic incentives to ensure fairness and cost-effectiveness in practical applications. This means considering broader economic and social factors, not just technical challenges, when designing blockchain systems. Through offline research activities, we aim to foster more attention and research on blockchain economics within the ecosystem.

## What is a Researcher House?

The Researcher House, as the name suggests, is a temporary haven for researchers to gather, learn, and conduct research together. We often feel that research is a complex and solitary endeavor, with researchers deeply immersed in countless materials.

Thus, we decided to launch an experiment by inviting outstanding researchers and top industry developers to reside in the Researcher House. In this environment, researchers are no longer isolated and can gain more research directions and inspiration through intensive brainstorming with peers and developers, promoting practical research outcomes.

## What is a Researchathon?

The concept of a Researchathon was first proposed and experimented by Tina from Flashbots. It proceeds as follows: a). A list of open problems is prepared in advance, and each question is assigned a relevant mentor (Navigator) based on their expertise and interest. b). The Navigator provides a brief introduction to their assigned topics, explaining its significance. c). Researchers select an open problem of interest and form discussion groups. d). Finally, each Navigator shares the key takeaways from their group, including but not limited to solutions, specifications, insights, and expected further research steps.

The goal of a Researchathon is to guide each group to quickly develop a rough specification of an open problem, identify its dependencies, and determine the next steps for research. For more detailed guidelines on Researchathons, please visit: http://preconf.wtf/.

To reduce the difficulty and ensure smooth progress of the Researchathon in the Shenzhen Researcher House, we will create a group chat one week in advance, where mentors will share curated materials and answer questions.

## Themes and Agenda

### ZKRollup Economics — ZKRollup from 1 to n

In this Researcher House, we will explore the existing problems and solutions in zkrollup system design through three main sections.

- We will start with the fundamentals of zkrollup, discussing the issues it aims to address, its basic components, and comparative solutions.
- Next, we will tackle the training wheels: how to achieve decentralization and censorship resistance in zkrollup. Topics will include forced inclusion mechanism for rollup, based rollup, decentralized sequencer, and decentralized prover.
- Finally, we will address the critical aspect of sustainable zkrollup fee mechanisms. ZKP has a characteristic where verification costs are low, but generating proofs is significantly more expensive. Thus, zkrollup requires a different fee mechanism than optimistic rollup and the Ethereum mainnet. For instance, keccak executes quickly, but generating proofs is slow. Charging fees based on keccak gas from the mainnet could make zkrollup vulnerable to DDoS attacks. Topics will include formalizing and categorizing zkrollup fee mechanisms and designing fee mechanisms for decentralized provers and sequencers.

### Agenda
