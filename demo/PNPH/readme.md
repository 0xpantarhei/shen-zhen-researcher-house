# PNPH

### Project Overview

This project introduces a new decentralized prover market mechanism designed to enable Layer 2 users to submit transactions with lower fees. The key advantage of this new mechanism is that each user's transaction will be validated and a proof generated as soon as possible, without being indefinitely delayed due to insufficient bidding prices.

### Core Features

We designed a Prover network that achieves the following goals:

- **User-Friendly:** Users only need to pay the market average price for services, and no additional knowledge is required from the user.
- **Prover-Incentive Friendly:** The value of orders your Prover receives is guaranteed to be greater than your costs, ensuring that provers always make a profit.
- **Maximized Transaction Volume:** Due to its user and prover-friendly nature, there's no need for competitive bidding, which significantly increases transaction efficiency.
